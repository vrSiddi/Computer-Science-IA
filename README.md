This is code for my computer science IA. It will not run off of other computers since it requires a connection to myPHPAdmin to function.

The goal of this website is to provide an organized and efficient method for people to write, organize, and store their college application essays. 
This website allows users to add colleges to a list. Under each college, they have the ability to add all their essay prompts.
The application will provide a space for the user to write a response to the essay prompts as well as a place to keep notes on each prompt.
The website will save and keep track of the users progress. The user can log out and come back to their essays anytime.
The website also tracks the user's progress in completing all the essays for a college.
It also tracks their statistics overall in the "Account Information" page.
